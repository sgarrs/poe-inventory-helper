*TODO*:
*   find properties
*   find the ranges of the same mod
**  return display ready set of item properties
    -- probably should use in React component
     item: {
       properties: [{}, ...{}],
       requirements: [{}, ...{}],
       implicitMods, ['', ...''],
       explicitMods: ['', ...''],
       flavorText: ['', ...'']
     }

*   sort by mod value
*   for each item's mod, include distance from max value
*+  determine item mod tiers
*?  how do we tell if a modifier's value is variable?
*+  combination search functions, e.g. getItemsInCategoryWithName
    - be able to run an unknown quantity of combinations
    - combinator function? add ... strings specifying search type which then run StashCollection getItem functions 
    - save for the React component?
    - account for unnecessary searches or errors in searches
      - search for "The Princess" vs search for item.category: 'weapons' with name "The Princess"
      - notify incompatible parameters and return a suggested result
        - search for item.category: { weapons: ['oneaxe'] } with name "The Princess"
        - send warning that "The Princess" is not an axe, but show results for "The Princess" swords
*+  pagination for broad search data to limit resource drain
